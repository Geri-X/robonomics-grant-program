## 2. Project Overview :bookmark_tabs:

<p align="center">

</p>

1. What are the problems that the project is trying to solve?
W2V Eco solutions solves problem of incentivizing usage of recycling materials in production cycle & collecting big data for analyzing market sentiment by:
 - creating recycling cryptoexchange 
 - smart bin solution
 - metaverse game for recycling/plogging activists
Smartbin is a proprietary hardware & software solution, that:
 - sorts pet plastic by color & transparency - electronic device
 - shreds it into flake (as prepared raw product for production) - hardware device
 - sends every recycling action into blockchain & rewards consumer - robonomics
Data on blockchain is shared with recycling crypto exchange.
The global network of installed smartbins is considered as a member of exchange as a network of IOT devices, providing truthful data of market sentiment & supply.

2. Why do you want Robonomics Network to be used for solving those problems? 
Network of smartbins globally is aimed to record all transactions in robonomics network to collect big data & shape a real time supply for recycling cryptoexchange parties & reward consumer with cryptocurrency to his wallet.

3. What are expected main result of the project?
Smartbin phase 1 development phase is aimed to complete full recycling cycle by:
 - color/transparency PET bottle detection & sorting
 - shredding a PET bottle
 - recording all data relating to recycling action to blockchain
 - rewarding consumers with crypto currency based on transactions recorded via Robonomics network.
Initially one device should be fully functional prototype according to cycle described above.

4. Do you plan to exploit the result in the future (academic, commercial)?
Yes, by completing working prototype smartbin device our company has plans to build a network of smart bin devices - an IOT network of robotics solutions for supplying chains for recycling crypto exchange.

5. What is your personal motivation to implement this project?
As a member of W2V recycling solutions company I am motivated to be a game changer for more sustainable society,that values recyclables as an economical value for building future infrastructure, leaving green grass & clean air for next generations.

6. Are there any other projects similar to yours? 
Alibaba launched their own network of recycling machines which use artificial intelligence in partnership with Unilever in China.
Tomra recycling machines are widely in usage across Europe.

7. In what way is your project different from the existing ones?
Smartbin unit not only collects PET bottle, but also turns pet plastic bottle into non-reversable secondary raw material - flake. 
Smartbin unit is a compact solution (a cube with 1m side dimension) comparing to Tomra (which represents a conveyor line with sorting devices)
Smartbin unit is going to use cryptocurrency as reward comparing to competition
Smartbin unit is compatible with game app, where user can spend his/her rewards as discounts, NFT or game/metaverse artifacts.


## 3. Technical Details :pager:

1. Details of how your project uses Robonomics Network.
    1. An overview of how you use the Robonomics technology stack in the development of your project.
    Each recycling action is recorded into blockchain, indicating timestamp, robot device id (smartbin id), number of items recycled, characteristics of recycled items (color, transparency - collected from sensor chips) & user id (user reference id in our mobile application). Robonomics blockchain transaction is a prove, that user should get a crypto reward in exchange of recycling action inside our app. 
Since Robonomics allows to use robots as autonomous agents connected between each other & shaping network of devices, we at W2V, use this feature to optimize our logistics.
We plan to record each recycling cycle performed by smartbin into transactions & calculating remaining space in the smartbin after each transaction. Since our devices are connected into a network of smart bins in a given locality - we can optimize our logistics process in a given location, by knowing each smartbin free remaining space & a volume our truck can collect from this location, therefore by reaching some threshold, all generated material should be collected in a location.
For storing recycling transactions we plan to use Robonomics datalog module
For sensors connectivity we plan to use Autonomous Intelligent Robot Agent package

    2. Description of the planned load on the Robonomics network: **indicate the period (3-9 months)** and briefly describe the intended purpose of the transactions.
    Planned load - one transaction per day or 90 transactions per 3 months.  Each transaction record includes: indicating timestamp, robot device id (smartbin id), number of items recycled, characteristics of recycled items (color, transparency - collected from sensor chips) & user id (user reference id in our mobile application)

## 8. Additional Information :information_source: 

We find out about Robonomics Grant Program From Twitter

Hardware solution is a part of whole W2V Ecosystem, which consists of:
1. Application for incentivizing people for proper sorting recyclables
2. Hardware smart container
3. Tokenized recyclables exchange
Our solution is based on several major principal such as:
- Creation of the incentive mechanism that is designed to reward economically an improved attitude for a proper PET bottles recycling
- Creation of an additional economic value by applying a blockchain-based platform and crypto currency token that generates intrinsic economic value for the platform users
- Transformation of the plastic as raw material into other real and digital commodities.
